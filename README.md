# jwitter
Here I will try to re-write entire Twitter backend with Java/Spring ecosystem: Spring Sessions Redis, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Spring Web MVC, Spring Batch and more.

After handling core functionalities (tweets, retweets, replies...) I aim to continue with chat functionality and Spring WebSockets.

Iteration logs:
15.11.2023 -> Initial setups are COMPLETED for: docker-compose and Docker secrets, authentication & authorization, Data JPA entities, project skeleton.
